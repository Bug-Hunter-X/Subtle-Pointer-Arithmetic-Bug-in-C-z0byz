# Subtle Pointer Arithmetic Bug in C
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to pointer arithmetic in C. The code appears correct at first glance, but it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes depending on the compiler and system architecture.  The bug is explained in detail below, along with a solution.

**Bug:**
The bug lies in how pointers are used and manipulated.  It involves potential issues with pointer arithmetic that might not always be caught by the compiler.  The error can manifest in different ways, possibly leading to incorrect results or segmentation faults.

**Solution:**
The solution will be more robust and address the potential pitfalls of pointer arithmetic. It will demonstrate better practices for pointer usage to avoid unexpected behaviors.
